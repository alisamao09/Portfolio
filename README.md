# [Project 1: Is systolic blood pressure reading related to gender, age, poverty, weight, sleep trouble, and smoking habit? American population-based study](https://github.com/alisamao09/STA302)
* Constructed multiple linear regression models and selected the one that has the largest impact on the change of systolic blood pressure and provides the most accurate predictions based on the dataset
* Explored mostly related variables to the change of systolic blood pressure reading (BPSysAve) and the best predictors for combined systolic blood pressure accurate reading
* Checked model inferences, predictability and scalability
* Performed diagnostic check
# [Project 2: How is diabetes readmission rate related to patients’ pathologic conditions and medications?](https://github.com/alisamao09/STA-303)
* Constructed several GLMs and GLMMs and chose the one with the best predictability, relatively good inferences and scalability
* Explored the best diabetes readmission rate predictors (“readmitted”)
* Analyzed the rudimentary information of patients, medications and laboratory tests taken during the diabetic encounter to identify patients with worse treatment outcomes and made them targeted to interventions to improve their outcomes and reduce costs by fewer readmission
* Performed diagnostic check
* Interpreted the final model and discussed limitations and potentials
