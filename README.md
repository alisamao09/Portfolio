# [Project 1: Machine Learning Classifiers on Traditional and Modern Tobacco Use](https://github.com/alisamao09/Machine-Learning-Classifiers-on-Traditional-and-Modern-Tobacco-Use)
* Tobacco use has an evidence-based association with many chronic diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, mental disorders, etc. Although combustible
cigarette use has declined in the US, the percentage of some users of modern tobacco products such as e-cigarette users who initiated at a young age is 3 times
higher in 2018 than 2014. Therefore, more attention should be focused on modern tobacco products with increasing prevalence. 
* However, most machine learning papers only focus on traditional combustible cigarette use. This motivated us to use machine learning methods to classify an individuals use status of modern tobacco products (Never user, Former user, and Current user) based on their use of other tobacco products combined with sociodemographic factors including age, ethnicity, and marital status. 
* Our results show that the Kernel Ridge Regression yields the best performance when compared with other machine learning methods when evaluated using MSE and AUC scores. Future work includes the application of these machine learning methods to a more balanced dataset and the inclusion of more information-rich features.
# [Project 2: Time Series Analysis：US-COVID-19-Cases-Analysis](https://github.com/alisamao09/US-COVID-19-Cases-Analysis)
* As is a contagious disease caused by a virus, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The disease has since spread worldwide, leading to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic[1]. Of those people who develop symptoms noticeable enough to be classed as patients, most (81%) develop mild to moderate symptoms (up to mild pneumonia), while 14% develop severe symptoms (dyspnea, hypoxia, or more than 50% lung involvement on imaging), and 5% suffer critical symptoms[2]. Older people are at a higher risk of developing severe symptoms.

* The goal of this final project is to investigate the potential patterns of COVID-19. We want to examine the following question:

**Can COVID-19 be well modeled by SARIMA and/or SEIR models?**

# [Project 3: Cervical Cancer Prediction Based on Machine Learning Algorithms](https://github.com/alisamao09/Cervical-Cancer-Prediction-Based-on-Machine-Learning-Algorithms)
* One of the main fatal diseases that threats women’s health is Cervical Cancer, which usually does not present any symptoms in early stages. When some symptoms appear, the patients’ condition might have been worsened and the cancer may have become metastatic. Therefore, early diagnosis of Cervical cancer risk factors can stop its tracks and reduce the mortality rate and the associated complications. 
* To seek for more accurate earlier diagnosis, we proposed a study of Cervical cancer diagnosis based on machine learning classification using Support Vector Classifier, Kernel Ridge regression, Logistic Regression, Lasso Regression, Random Forest Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier, and Multilayer Perceptron. The dataset has around 30 variables describing over 800 patients’ demographic information, habits, and historic medical records. It includes four targets (Hinselmann, Schiller, Cytology, and Biopsy). The four targets are used as the measurement for cancer predictions in this project. We also used SMOTE method to handle the imbalanced dataset. Evaluation metrics include Mean Squared Error, R squared, precision, recall, F1 score, and Area Under Curve. 
* Our results show that the Multilayer Perceptron yields the best performance for Hinselmann, and the Gradient Boosting Classifier yields the best performance for the other three targets when compared with other machine learning methods. Future work includes the application of these machine learning methods to a more balanced and real large scale hospital dataset and the inclusion of more informationrich features.
# [Project 4: Classifying students' open-ended responses in large class](https://github.com/alisamao09/research-project-1)
* Tested multiple training and test filters to filter out non-answers, with a success rate above 90%
* Pre-processed text data by stemming words, removing stop words and punctuations, making lowercase, and including "tuples"
* Calculated word frequency by TFIDF
* Explored multiple unsupervised clustering algorithms such as K-means, affinity clustering, and GMM etc.
* Projected clusterings to 2D space and printed out N important terms for each cluster
# [Project 5: How is diabetes readmission rate related to patients’ pathologic conditions and medications?](https://github.com/alisamao09/STA-303)
* Constructed several GLMs and GLMMs and chose the one with the best predictability, relatively good inferences and scalability
* Explored the best diabetes readmission rate predictors (“readmitted”)
* Analyzed the rudimentary information of patients, medications and laboratory tests taken during the diabetic encounter to identify patients with worse treatment outcomes and made them targeted to interventions to improve their outcomes and reduce costs by fewer readmission
* Performed diagnostic check
* Interpreted the final model and discussed limitations and potentials
# [Project 6: Map interaction design](https://github.com/alisamao09/Map-interaction-design)
* Applied shapes to water condition improvement methods for visual representation
* Designed and formatted the charts, and set up tool tips
* Arranged objects in containers 
* Designed the layout for the mobile app and the website
# [Experimental design: how does the distance between the hand and the head of the chopstick and the side of hands affect the total time needed to pick up all red beans in a bowl by chopsticks?](https://github.com/alisamao09/Design-and-Analysis-of-Experiments)
* Used factorial design, performed 20 experiments in total, two distances of 15cm and 10cm are set between the thumb and the chopstick head
* Took influence factors into considerations and tried to eliminate other factors
* Constructed linear model, interaction plot, QQ plot, confidence intervals, and T-tests etc.
