Data science projects, 2019-2020
# [Project 1: Is systolic blood pressure reading related to gender, age, poverty, weight, sleep trouble, and smoking habit? American population-based study](https://github.com/alisamao09/STA302)
* Constructed multiple linear regression models and selected the one that has the largest impact on the change of systolic blood pressure and provides the most accurate predictions based on the dataset
* Explored mostly related variables to the change of systolic blood pressure reading (BPSysAve) and the best predictors for combined systolic blood pressure accurate reading
* Checked model inferences, predictability and scalability
* Performed diagnostic check
# [Project 2: How is diabetes readmission rate related to patients’ pathologic conditions and medications?](https://github.com/alisamao09/STA-303)
* Constructed several GLMs and GLMMs and chose the one with the best predictability, relatively good inferences and scalability
* Explored the best diabetes readmission rate predictors (“readmitted”)
* Analyzed the rudimentary information of patients, medications and laboratory tests taken during the diabetic encounter to identify patients with worse treatment outcomes and made them targeted to interventions to improve their outcomes and reduce costs by fewer readmission
* Performed diagnostic check
* Interpreted the final model and discussed limitations and potentials
# [Project 3: Covid-19 What’s all the fuss?](https://github.com/alisamao09/ARC-480)
* Demonstrated patterns between COVID-19 case counts and the ongoing discussion of the virus on social media
* Scraped key phrases in tweets regarding COVID by ScrapeStorm, filtering them by tweet location (Toronto) and months (March to December)
* Found the most frequent words by calculating word frequencies using WriteWords
* Represented the varying frequency (number of appearances) of words within tweets by months by the Height of words
* Represented death cases in Toronto during the same time period by hospital bed changes in size
* Visualized the variation of word frequencies and death cases in Grasshopper:
- Created a list containing all data (number of words and cases) by month (8 months in all), extruded them using the data as the height (scaled death cases by 0.001 due to its huge amount)
- Visualized those changes by changing number slider, from the first month to the final month
- Applied materials to texts and the hospital bed
* Represent the rate of social activity of the Toronto Public Health account by birds flying around the words, according to data found on SocialBlade
* Analyzed limitations, subjectivity, data bias and the potential of this project
