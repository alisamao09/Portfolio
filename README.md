# Project 1: Is systolic blood pressure reading related to gender, age, poverty, weight, sleep trouble, and smoking habit? American population-based study
* Constructed multiple linear regression models and selected the one that have largest impact on the change of systolic blood pressure and provides the most accurate predictions based on the dataset
* Analyzed the behaviors or body properties contributing most to systolic blood pressure to maintain a good health
* Explored mostly related variables to the change of systolic blood pressure reading (BPSysAve) and the best predictors for combined systolic blood pressure accurate reading
* Checked model inferences, predictability and scalability
* Performed diagnostic check
